# Cucumber-Automation-with-OrangeHRM-Practice
## What is Cucumber Automation:
Cucumber is a popular Behavior Driven Development (BDD) tool used in test automation to write and execute test cases in a human-readable format. It uses a plain-text language called Gherkin to define test scenarios that can be easily understood by all stakeholders including business analysts, developers, and testers.

Cucumber allows users to define test scenarios in a simple and structured format, and then automatically generates executable code that can be run against the application under test. This helps to ensure that the application behaves as expected and meets the business requirements.

Cucumber also provides integration with various programming languages such as Java, Ruby, and Python, making it a flexible and versatile tool for test automation. It is widely used in agile software development processes where collaboration and communication between team members are key.
